# B_anthracis_classification

Code for classifying whole genome *B. anthracis* isolates

The python code in this repository can be used to classify *B. anthracis* isolates according to the methodology described in "A classification framework for Bacillus anthracis defined by global genomic structure" published in Evolutionary Application in December of 2019: https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12911

Because this is a modified version of code originally written by Kat Holt and Zoe Dyson for *S. typhi*, analagous usage intructions can be found here: https://github.com/katholt/genotyphi#original-implementation-pre-mapped-data
